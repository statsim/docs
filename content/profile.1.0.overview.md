summary: Generate visual summaries of tabular datasets using an intuitive web interface

## Data profiling

Understanding data is a crucial skill in many industries. Generally, people are not good at recognizing patterns and extracting insights from raw tabular datasets. We are not computers. That's why data visualization and profiling are so important and used so often. They convert numbers into something regular people can understand. Charts. Trends. Statistics. Data profiling makes it possible to generate bird-view summaries of tabular files. It provides detailed information and descriptive statistics about each variable stored in a dataset.
