summary: People are not really good at pattern recognition when dealing with raw tabular data. That's why data visualization and statistical summaries are used so often. Similarly, data profiling is used to get a bird-view summary of tabular datasets. It provides descriptive statistics about each column (variable) of the input dataset. With StatSim.Profile it's possible to perform data profiling online, just in the browser. Keep in mind that data is processed locally.
