    "All models discussed before were basically regular programs. They take input and produce deterministic output. Deterministic here means no matter how many times you rerun the model, or repeat the experiment, you get the same output for same input. Determinstic models are very useful, however in real-world we ofter deal with uncertainty. It means that each time you can't be 100% sure about the outcome, even knowing all the input parameters. The good news is we know how to reason and work with uncertainty - using probability theory. The bad news is probability theory is not really obvious and has some caveats.  "

    "There're events we can't reason about in terms of frequency. They are too rare or have happened in the past. It's just impossible to use the formula below to describe their uncertainty, however using the probability theory still seems like a good choice to work with such events. Let's use one of the basic examples - throwing a coin. Assume that we performed infinitely big number of experiments with that coins and know that the coin is not biased or in a frequentist sence probability of falling for each side top is 1/2. After throwing the coin one player looks at the result and see that it's Heads. For another player the result is still hidden. What is the probability of the result being Heads in such case?"

When tossing 2 dice in a board game, it's more important to know the sum of dice not the individual values. A quantity, or more formally a function, that assigns a numerical value to each outcome of the experiment called a random variable. Because random variables are based on random outcomes we can also use probability theory to work with them. In modeling it's much easier to deal with random variables rather than raw events."
