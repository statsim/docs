    "The latest version of StatSim uses [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) to run the models. The model code is isolated from the main document and don't make it freeze when processed. The drawback is a smaller stack size in the worker process ([details..](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=252492)). That's not a problem when doing simulations, but processing big arrays causes a recursion error.\n",
