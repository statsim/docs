    "We started from deterministic models. Such models are often embedded in regular computer programs as calculators, formulas, system relationships. Then we added probabilistic variables as main primitives of stochastic (random) models. A probabilistic model describes a sampling process and it's output is not deterministic, but random. Fixed inputs doesn't produce same outputs. Strictly speaking such output is a function of the model's random variables so it's also a random variable.\n",

    "Getting random output of the probabilistic model could be useful in many cases. Throwing dice is probably the most popular example. It's quite similar to running a regular program with some tricky `random()` calls. When you simply run a probabilistic model you get a sample as an output. That's only one of all possible values of corresponding random variable. However we often need not a sample, but a probabilistic distribution as an output. So we could reason about what values are more likely, what is the credible interval etc. The process of finding probability distributions of unknown random variables of a model is called *inference*. \n",
