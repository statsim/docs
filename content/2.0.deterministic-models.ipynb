    "> *Deterministic model.* Mathematical model in which outcomes are precisely determined through known relationships among states and events, without any room for random variation. In such models, a given input will always produce the same output, such as in a known chemical reaction. In comparison, stochastic models use ranges of values for variables in the form of probability distributions. [source](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/deterministic-model.html)"

    "Why creating models\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "Models represent relationships between some quantities and qualities. Sometimes people can construct such models in their mind, without really understanding they are modeling something. We don't need special software to calculate simple things. However when the number of quantities and their inter-connection grow we need a tool to deal with the complexity. Especially hard to reason about values that have some kind of feedback."
