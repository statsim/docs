## Overview

People use Machine Learning to solve different types of problems. One of its most common applications is prediction. Given some independent observations (usually represented as rows in a table) the task is to predict target values for future observations. To make this prediction a model is trained on seen data (training set). Such data consists of a target variable and predictors, sometimes called features. Features are basically columns used to predict target values. Fitting (training) a model means finding relationship between features and targets. A dataset used for predictions should contain features same as in the training dataset.

## How to fit a model

Previously fitting a model required using a programming language like [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) or [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)). Today there are a lot of web-based tools that provide similar functionality using only a graphical user interface. The only problem with those tools is they require data to be transferred and stored somewhere in the *cloud*. In most cases that means extra registration steps, fees and security issues. 
With [StatSim.Fit](statsim.com/fit/) you can fit machine learning models online using your machine's resources. That means data is processed locally, no need for registration, and the tool is free.

To fit a model:

1. Select a training dataset in the CSV format
2. Select a dataset for prediction
3. Choose a target variable (the variable you want to predict)
4. Select and customize a model
5. Click *Run*

That's all!
