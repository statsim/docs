To run the model and get results click the blue button `Compile and Run`. Each model (program) consists of building blocks. Our new simple program just sums two variables and displays results.

That new variable has [Gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) with parameters `Mu` (mean) equal to `5` and `Sigma` (standard deviation) equal to `3`."
