    "In previous chapters we describe how to build probabilistic models using blocks of random variables. Such models provide us a way to reason about real-life processes and events in a forward direction, starting with a random unknown input going to the results we can process and analyze. StatSim thanks to WebPPL, a probabilistic language it based on, makes it possible to reason in backward direction. Knowing something about the results, get a distribution of variables it based. Broadly speaking it's a csituation when we have partial information about the model or assume it and try to figure out distribution of still unknown quantities. \n",

What rejection sampling can also do is reject samples that don't satisfy the `Condition` blocks. It continues generating and rejecting values until the total number of successful (such that satisfy provided conditions) samples is equal to the `Samples` parameter of the model. Using that technique we can model conditional probability and think in backward style. If the output is equal to X what is the input."

    "Binomial distribution defines a random variable that equals to number of successful (`true`) results of `N` Bernoulli random variables with the same probability of success for each variable equal to `P`. Let's say our experiment consists of throwing a coin `10` times and counting number of `Heads`. Such value is distributed according to Binomial distribution with the parameter `N` equal to `10`. What if after performing the experiment we got `2` heads? How can we reason about the `P`? The point estimate can give us its value equal to `2/10` but can we trust such estimate? Let's model that!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create out target variable `P` as a uniformly distributed on the range `(0,1)` random  variable. That variable is used as a parameter `P` of the Binomial distribution for the second variable `ProbAmount`. At that point `ProbAmount` will generate an output containing possible values Binomial distribution can return with all different values of `P`. But it's not what we are interested in. We need to condition on `ProbAmount` being equal to `2` and examine `P`. To do that add a third block `Condition` containing the expression `ProbAmount === 2`. Now, if we output `ProbAmount` it will show only one scalar value `2` no matter how many samples we generate. But if we add `P` to the output instead of `ProbAmount` the result will show the distribution we are interested in. "

    "Conditioning on continious variables\n",
    "--------------------------------------------\n",
    "It's important to understand how the rejection sampling algorithm works because sometimes it can stuck if used not correctly. Because it rejects samples until they satisfy all the `condition` blocks, if you create a condition that is always false, the program will freeze. That is the case when conditioning on continious variables with strong rules like `A === 0.5` where A is a continious random variable. In continuous case the probability of getting one specific value is equal to `0` so rejection sampler generates thousands of values immediately rejecting them. "
