    "\n",
    "1. Each random variable should have a name. StatSim automatically gives a name to a new random variable, however you can change it whenever you want in the `Name` field.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second field determines variable size. If this value is more than 1, a random array will be created\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The third required field is a probability distribution. It actually define randomness of the random variable. How likely are certain values compared to another values. There are more than 20 built-in distributions in StatSim. [The full list of probability distributions in WebPPL](http://docs.webppl.org/en/master/distributions.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Each random distribution has its own parameters. For example `Uniform` distribution need `a` and `b` that set bottom and upper limit for the random variable all values of which are equally likely. The `Gaussian` asks for the mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma`.\n",
    "\n",

    "Choosing a simulation method\n",
    "-------------------------------\n",
    "After finishing designing a stochastic model you need one more thing to do before running the simulation. By default, StatSim uses `Deterministic` simulation method. It simply executes the model once. Just as a regular program. If you run a stochastic model with such method, the output you will get will be a simple scalar value, probably not what you really need. In the next version StatSim will automatically choose a simulation method depending on the added blocks, however understanding different types of methods is still needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Deterministic* - the model is evaluated once as a regular deterministic program\n",
    "2. *Enumeration* - the app enumerates all possible execution paths and tries to find the solution analytically. Works only with discrete distributions. Not always.\n",
    "3. *Rejection Sampling* - generates samples according to created blocks. Rejects samples according to the `Condition` block. Each sample is independent. That's good! However the rejection sampler can stuck when condition. \n",
    "4. *MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo)* - generates samples with Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Such samples don't really uses random variables from the model to generate samples, it rather uses their and `Observer` likelihoods (strictly speaking log-likelihoods) to choose the next step on the parameter space. \n",
    "5. *HMC (Hamiltonian Monte Carlo)* - sampling algorithm similar to MCMC. It reduces the correlation between sampled states using a Hamiltonian evolution. It's a good option when input to the `Factor` block is a function of multiple variables. However it's more sensitive to changing method parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "There're some more simulation method in StatSim, but you at the moment these 5 are enoght. I'll not dive into details here and probably add a separate section later."
